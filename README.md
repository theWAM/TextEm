# TextEm!
Hello! This is TextEm, a simple python project made to increase productivity for those of us who have iphones but no macs. 
Being incapable of texting from our laptops forces us to turn to our phones, which tend to drain productivity.
In it's first stages, the app will be able to send texts from your email, but hopefully, the app will grow!
